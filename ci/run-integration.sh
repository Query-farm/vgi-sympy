# Run this repo's sqllogictest suite (test/sql/*.test) against the vgi-sympy
# VGI worker, using a prebuilt standalone `haybarn-unittest` and the signed
# community `vgi` extension — no C++ build from source. See ci/README.md.
#
# The SAME suite is exercised over three VGI transports, selected by $TRANSPORT.
# The vgi extension picks the transport from the LOCATION string the .test files
# ATTACH (`${VGI_SYMPY_WORKER}`):
#
#   subprocess : a bare stdio command (`uv run sympy_worker.py`) — the extension
#                spawns the worker per query and talks Arrow IPC over
#                stdin/stdout. Default; current behavior.
#   http       : the worker is started out-of-band in `--http` mode on an auto
#                port; LOCATION becomes `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
#   unix       : the worker is started out-of-band on an AF_UNIX socket;
#                LOCATION becomes `unix://<sock>`.
#
# Required environment:
#   HAYBARN_UNITTEST   path to the haybarn-unittest binary
#   TRANSPORT          subprocess | http | unix (default: subprocess)
#   WORKER_CMD         the stdio command that runs the worker (e.g.
#                      `uv run --no-sync --python 3.13 <repo>/sympy_worker.py`).
#                      Used directly as the LOCATION for subprocess, and as the
#                      process booted for http/unix. For back-compat, if
#                      WORKER_CMD is unset but VGI_SYMPY_WORKER is a bare command
#                      (not an http:// / unix:// URL) it is used as WORKER_CMD.
# Optional:
#   STAGE              scratch dir for the preprocessed test tree (default: mktemp)
